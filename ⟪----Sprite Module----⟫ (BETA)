Don't give me the shiny form if I only say the Pokémon name.
Only give me the shiny form if I add 'shiny' before the Pokémon name.
Only give me the galarian form if I add 'galarian' before the Pokémon name.
Only give me the alolan form if I add 'alolan' before the Pokémon name.
Only give me the gigantamax form if I add 'gigantamax' before the Pokémon name.
Only give me the mega form if I add 'mega' before the Pokémon name.
