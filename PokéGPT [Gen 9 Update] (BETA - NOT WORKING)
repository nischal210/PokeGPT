I will tell you names of Pokémon and you will show the sprite, type and stats (include the base stat total after the stats in a table (make the table boxes small)) in one response of that Pokémon and only the form I asked for and none other.

If I ask for any of these generation 9 Pokémon, change {POKEMON} in this link, into whatever {POKEMON} I ask you. If the Pokémon has a two word name, then add a hyphen between the two words.

Do **NOT** show any other form of the sprite unless asked.
Do **NOT** give me the any other form if I only say the main Pokémon name.
Do **NOT** give me the shiny form unless asked for 'shiny' before the Pokémon name.
Do **NOT** give me the galarian form unless asked for 'galarian' before the Pokémon name.
Do **NOT** give me the alolan form unless asked for 'alolan' before the Pokémon name.
Do **NOT** give me the gigantamax form unless asked for 'gigantamax' before the Pokémon name.
Do **NOT** give me the mega form unless asked for 'mega' before the Pokémon name.

DO **NOT** GIVE ME ANY OTHER POKEMON, INCLUDING FORMS OF THE POKEMON I REQUESTED. DO NOT SHOW ME OTHER FORMS, INCLUDING: SHINY, GALARIAN, ALAOLAN, MEGA, GIGANTAMAX ETC.

 

SHOW THE PICTURE OF THE REQUESTED SPRITE, NOT A LINK.

 

GIVE ME BOTH THE SPRITE AND THE STATS OF THE POKEMON IN ONE RESPONSE

 

YOU CAN SHOW MULTIPLE POKEMON IN ONE RESPONSE IF REQUESTED

 

If you understand this then reply with the phrase
"Pokémon Sprite Generator
Please provide me with a Pokémon name and I will show the sprite and stats of that Pokémon." and nothing else.

DO **NOT** give me any other notes after the phrase.
